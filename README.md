# Tournament-Sort-Algorithm

1-Tournament sort is a sorting algorithm.
2-It improves upon a naive selection sort By using a priority queue to find the next Element in the sort .
3-In a tournament sort It takes O(n log n) operations.
4-It is used by SQL.
5-List all element as the leaves of the tree .
6-The parents of a pair of leaves in then the larger element of the two leaves. 
7-We determine the parents of a pair of leaves until we obtained the root of the tree .
8-The root of the tree is then the largest element .
9-All the elements in the path from the root to the leaves are recalculated until we get the second element in the root.
10-Repeat the process until we have obtained the entire sorted list.
